# Combine imports in Python programs.
#
# How to use from within vim:
#
# Mark all imports in visual-mode, filter through !combineimports
#
# Example:
#
# from foo import blah as _blah, foo2, bar
# :'<,'>!combineimports
#
# Will result in:
#
# from foo import (
#       bar, blah as _blah, foo2)
#
body() {
    # Only emit the body to stdout
    #
    # See: http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/11856/11108
    #
    # Take the first line of stdin and emit it immediately on stdout
    # (essentially bypassing all the upcoming pipes) then send the
    # rest of the input to stdout.
    # To be used in a pipeline, like for example:
    #
    # $ cat report.csv | body sort
    IFS= read -r header
    printf '%s\n' "$header"
    "$@"
